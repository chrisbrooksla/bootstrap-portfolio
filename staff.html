          <p>The tirelessly experimental, gorgeously
          grandiose production of George Martin is
          synonymous with the Beatles — and
          understandably so. His studio
          stewardship of the group for most of
          their existence went far beyond the
          traditional producer role and, together,
          they pushed the limits of what pop music
          could sound like. But Martin’s career
          predated the Fab Four and would continue
          long after they broke up.
          <br> 
          <br> 
          He lent his
          formidable, innovative production and
          arranging talents to a variety of pop,
          novelty and soundtrack sessions in the
          early days; and his work with a panoply
          of top-name rock artists from the
          Fifties through the Nineties solidified
          a legacy that didn’t even need it. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Some notable records that Sir George has done include: 
          The Beatles, 'Rubber Soul' (1965)
          The Beatles, 'The White Album' (1968)
          Jeff Beck, 'Blow by Blow' (1975)
          The Beatles, 'Revolver' (1966)
          'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'
          (1967)

          <p>Brian Eno is a producer, writer, and
          multi-instrumental musician, legendary
          both in his own right as a pioneer of
          ambient music, and in the work he’s done
          across his vast career with others, like
          Bryan Ferry’s band Roxy Music. He is
          perhaps best known in mainstream circles
          for his incomparable synthesizer and
          soundscapes work on David Bowie’s
          “Berlin Trilogy” of albums — Low,
          Heroes, and Lodger — all produced by
          Tony Visconti with visionary help from
          Eno, and for his work with artists like
          U2, The Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, and
          King Crimson.
        <br>
        <br>
        A self-described "non-musician", Eno has
        helped introduce unique conceptual
        approaches and recording techniques to
        contemporary music.He has been
        described as one of popular music's most
        influential and innovative figures.
        <br>
        <br>
        Notable records that Eno has produced include: 
        Talking Heads’ Top 20 album 'Remain in Light' (1980) 
        and U2’s chart-topping albums 'Unforgettable Fire' (1984), 
        'The Joshua Tree' (1987), 
        and 'Achtung Baby' (1991).

          <p>George Clinton revolutionized funk and
          R&B at large as the mastermind of
          Parliament and Funkadelic. Versed in
          gospel, doo wop, and soul, Clinton -- a
          singer, songwriter, bandleader, and
          master conceptualist -- scored his first
          hit as co-writer and lead vocalist of
          the Parliaments' "(I Wanna) Testify"
          (1967), a fiery if tame precursor to
          what he and his ever-changing collective
          unleashed the following decade,
          highlighted by a clutch of animated and
          everlasting funk classics that topped
          the R&B chart.
          <br> 
          <br> 
          While P-Funk temporarily
          laid dormant, Clinton went solo with
          Computer Games (1982), the source of
          another number one R&B hit, "Atomic
          Dog," leading to three additional albums
          for Capitol. A hip-hop godfather, his
          P-Funk and solo recordings have been
          sampled innumerable times, and he has
          worked in the flesh with many of those
          whose creativity he has fueled, from
          Digital Underground and Snoop Dogg to
          OutKast and Kendrick Lamar. 
          <br>
          <br>
           If there was a Mount Rushmore
          for funk, Clinton would no doubt be part
          of the sculpture between the likes of
          James Brown and Sly Stone.</p>

          <p>Undoubtedly one of the single most
          important and influential producers in
          the history of rock music, Phil
          Spector's "Wall Of Sound" stands as a
          milestone in recording history. Spector
          raised pop production's ambition and
          production by overdubbing scores of
          musicians to create a massive roar. It
          changed the course of pop record
          producing and produced some of rock's
          best loved music.
          <br>
          <br>
          To an extent that had never been
          imagined in rock & roll, Spector pumped
          his records full of orchestration --
          strings, horns, rattling percussion --
          that coalesced into teenage symphonies,
          never overwhelming the material or the
          passionate vocals. Often called a mad
          genius because of his eccentric and
          temperamental behavior, Spector's
          idiosyncrasies were almost always
          validated by the artistic and commercial
          results of his sessions, which combined
          dozens of instruments and innovative
          production techniques into end products
          which only he could combine into works
          of art. His influence was immense, not
          only in the dozens of imitation Wall of
          Sound productions (some very accurate
          and worthy, it must be added) that
          flooded the market between 1962 and
          1965, but as an inspiration to Brian
          Wilson of the Beach Boys, Rolling Stones
          producer Andrew Loog Oldham, and others.
